# Styles

This repository provides a framework agnostic theme for intended use alongside any object or tagged template literal framework.

## Getting Started

Add the library to your project as a dependency using:

```
npm i @friendswithsitters/styles --save
```
---

The library is implemented to ensure that it is easy to take advantage of [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), including numerous helpers designed at producing strings of CSS compatible with various pre-processing frameworks.
